Meeting notes: 5/4/16

We talked about the two main streams of work that we can split up into.

## Cabinet
This group will handle the design, build and painting.

### Design

Initial thoughts on what steps we need to take.

* Sketch out how we want the cabinet to look
* Convert the sketch into a format where we can get dimensions figured out for all
 * Could just be graph paper
* Create list of materials and estimate cost

### Build
* Find a workspace
 * Makerspace or someone's garage
* Once all pieces are cut we'll transfer to the office
* We'll let the XSD team paint 
* Assemble 
* Attach screen, computer, controls
* Final Touches

## Computer/Software

To start out we'll just focus on building a machine that can run MAME and arcade ROMS.  In the future we could make updates to allow for N64, PS or other console emulation.

### Controls

* Decide on # of players
* Decide if we'll use a kit or custom build
* Build interface to computer

### Computer

* Decide on hardware specs
* Decide on OS (probably linux, but what flavor)
* Build Machine
* Install OS
* Get MAME running
* Create Slalom branded splash screen that launches on startup
